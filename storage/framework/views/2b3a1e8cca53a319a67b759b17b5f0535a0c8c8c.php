                            Felicity’s Guitars has been in business since 2002 when my Dad, an apprentice luthier at the time, first opened a small guitar repair shop in our garage. Over the years our family’s interest in fine and rare guitars has never waned an inch, and now 20 years later, we’re blessed to be able to offer our select portfolio of electric and acoustic guitars for your consideration as well as large number of accoutrements and even some very exotic Indonesian instruments.

                <p>
                    The instrument must be delivered with strings mounted and under normal (standard tuning) tension, so that an immediate evaluation of any intervention work can be made on			the spot. Please tune your instrument to tension at least 24-hrs before presenting for evaluation. Our service estimate will be made post-evaluation at the time of delivery of the 		instrument, and we will issue a detailed worksheet along with the collection date.

                <p>
                    We can, under special circumstances, carry out a remote evaluation for intervention via email with adequate photographs and/or video supplied by the Client. For more 				information see our price list below. To make an appointment, please use the contact us app.

                <p> We’ll give your guitar a thorough inspection inside and out, letting you know what is correct and what may need attention now or in the near future. Frets, neck, action, bridge 			and bridge plate, truss rod, tuners, and internal bracing are some of the things that are assessed.

                <h4 class="text-gold font-weight-bold">Acoustic Guitar Setups</h4>
                <p>
                    Most acoustic guitars will benefit from an annual setup, and instruments that are kept in less than ideal climate conditions (or that are on the road a lot) may need two per year. 			We’ll evaluate your guitar and make a recommendation. Setups may include truss rod nut lubrication and adjustment, saddle lowering to adjust action, nut slot adjustments, 			cleaning of grimy frets and fretboard, adjusting tuners, installing new strings, and checking electronics and batteries. Price is based on what your guitar needs. The price range is 			for labor and does not include parts costs such as strings and bone nut and saddle blanks.
                </p>
                <p>
                    NOTE: On some guitars, fret work may be needed in order to reduce or eliminate buzzing. Fret work is not included in a setup; see prices for fret work below.

                </h3>
                <p>
                    Setting up electric guitars and bass guitars can include truss rod lubrication and adjustment, bridge height and radius adjustment, setting intonation, adjusting tuners, and 			adjusting the nut slots for correct action at the first fret. Restringing and cleaning and polishing of the fretboard and frets is also included.
                </p>
                <p>
            		NOTE: Due to the nature of electric guitar construction, it is extremely common for these instruments to need fret work to play well. 80% or more of electrics, especially those 			with bolt-on necks, have high frets in the tongue area that must be addressed in order to play without excess buzzing. This includes most new electric guitars right off the shelf. 			Please see the fret work section below for fret work pricing.

                <p>
                    Many guitars (even new guitars) need the frets leveled in order to play cleanly with low action. Most electric guitars with bolt-on necks come from the factory with high tongue frets. Doing great fret work is a learned art, and we guarantee that you will be happy with ours. All our fret work jobs are performed with the guitar mounted in a neck jig that 	simulates string tension. This ensures very accurate work. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    Re-fret jobs include leveling the fretboard if needed.

                    Refinishing Acoustics and Electrics
                </h3>
                <p>
                    We can professionally refinish your instrument using a variety of the highest quality finish work materials, including nitrocellulose and polyurethane. The work required to refinish 		each guitar will vary based on its size, existing damage –if any– such as cracks, dents, previous repairs and/or excessive coating that will require sanding removal. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    As such; estimates for refinishing work can only be made after reviewing the instruments particulars. 

                </p>
                <p class="text-gold"><i>The owner of the instrument should also be aware and carefully consider that refinishing work – even the best quality refinish – will almost certainly reduce the re-sale value 		of your instrument. We do not refinish true vintage instruments beyond damage or crack repair for this reason.</i></p>

                <p>Shop Hourly Rate is $40.00 per hour. Since each guitar is unique, prices quoted are estimates and may be adjusted based on the actual time involved.

                <p>Express service and rush jobs may be charged extra pending current workload. Generally we can perform setups and fret dress jobs in 1-3 days. Other services may take longer. 			We always strive to meet the scheduling needs of our customers – whenever possible – and without cutting corners. </p>

                    A 10% non-refundable deposit will hold any guitar for sixty (60) days from the time of receipt of the customer’s deposit. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    When an instrument is placed on hold for a customer, it is guaranteed to be reserved for the depositor (customer) exclusively and withdrawn from our sales inventory by cataloging the instrument as being “on hold”. The instrument will remain displayed on our website for viewing purposes only.  
                </p>
                <p>
                    No subsequent offer made by any other customer − regardless of the amount − will break a hold guarantee once it has been reserved by deposit.  
                </p>
                <p>
                    In return, we trust in good faith that a hold request is a sincere commitment to finalize the purchase within sixty (60) days. Instruments held by deposit, once paid for in full and shipped, are considered final and ineligible for return and/or refund. No exceptions.

                <p>For International orders; all sales are considered final. This is due to local Customs' re-importation duties/taxes/fees and bureaucratic red-tape that we will unavoidably incur on our end. Sorry. Again, please correspond with us prior to purchasing if you have any questions or uncertainties.</p> 
                <p>For local orders; if upon receipt if you are dissatisfied with your purchase, you must notify us within 24 hours. Items cannot be returned unless it arrives in a condition other than how it was described or photographed. We strongly encourage the Customer to make a video recording of the actual unboxing process and item inspection, as we do, prior to shipping.  </p>
                <p>Customer is responsible for all shipping, insurance and bank charges incurred. Any guitar returned not in the same condition as sent or for a frivolous reason is subject to 10% or more restocking fee at our sole discretion. All returns must be fully insured.

                <p>We routinely ship all amplifiers in a custom constructed lightweight pinewood crate to add an extra layer of protection to the original factory packaging (box). This may marginally increase the shipping cost based on the overall dimensions and/or weight.  </p>
                <p id="shipping">As all Amplifier sales are considered final, the customer is welcome to opt-out and specify shipment without the wood crate, but we highly recommend this added layer of protection be used − which we are ‘happy’ to provide free of charge for materials and labor. </p>
